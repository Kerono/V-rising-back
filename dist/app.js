    with saves on earlier versions. So with this next patch, just like the others that have come before it, you will be required to play on a new save to experience the new content.
    With every update, we also recognize that you don't want to lose your progress, and if you're anything like us, you become very attached
    to the castles you've built and the adventures you've taken, and perhaps most importantly, the hats you've collected. For this reason, we provide a 
    backlog of older versions so that you can play an older branch of V Rising and load up your previous saves. In this way, as long as you have the save, you can 
    always finish your journey on that version, or just visit to marvel at all of your accomplishments. Sit on your throne, say hello to your servants, and make sure they 
    haven't stumbled into any stakes.`,

    We stalk the night. We want blood under our fingers, and sometimes, wielding a deadly implement like a spear or a bow doesn't have quite the visceral engagement with the hunt
    that we so crave.Enter: THE CLAWS. This is the first of three weapons we're going to be adding to V Rising in the 1.1 update, and one that has been in high demand ever since
    our early access release. The first thing you do as a Vampire is cut into your foes fingers first, but after you pick up your first blade, it's rarely appropriate to 
    return to your savage beginnings and really dig into our ever-lurking bestial nature again.`,

        info: `From the earliest days of V Rising development, when players first got their hands on the game, one thing was clear: there was a strong desire to bring your own unique 
    vision of a Vampire to life. What should a Vampire look like? How should they feel? We've steadily refined and expanded the game with each update to help you live out that fantasy.
    To give you the tools for this, we introduced new ways to express yourself, like adding armor appearances that let you shape your Vampire's look to match your ideal vision. 
    You can recolor your gear, override the appearance of your current set, and bring your flair to life in a way that feels truly yours. Alongside these visuals, we added “classes” of
    armor at different tiers, enabling you to tailor your combat stats to fit specific playstyles, whether you prefer the agility of a rogue or the spellcasting prowess of a caster. 
    In this way, your character's look and gameplay reinforce one another, making your vision whole.We're pretty happy with the options we've delivered so far, and while 
    wardrobe improvements (especially in the weapon department) may still be on the horizon in 1.1, today's blog isn't about appearances.V Rising is ultimately about the
    experience of being a Vampire. That experience comes to life not just in how you look but in how you play. With that in mind, let's talk about combat stats because they're
    about to get a massive overhaul.`,
